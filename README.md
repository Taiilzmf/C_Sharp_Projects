# The Tech Academy C# Projects

This repository holds all of my C# and .Net Framework assignments.
We learned how to create the game of BlackJack showcasing abstraction, polymorphism,
and inheritance. We also created a website to allow users to sign up for car insurance
and automatically price out a quote. Another assignment was creating a newsletter
that utilizes Entity Framework 6, and creates a sign up that auto adds members to our
database.
